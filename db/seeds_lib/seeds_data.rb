The ship offers unique dining, entertainment and cabin options not found on other ships in the fleet. In addition to staples like kids clubs, an adults-only retreat and a waterpark, new activities include the SkyRide suspended bike course, the first IMAX theater at sea and a Dr. Seuss-inspired library.

Those who select Family Harbor cabins receive exclusive 24-hour lounge access with free breakfast and kid-friendly movies and games. Plus, children staying in these rooms enjoy free meals at most specialty restaurants and a free night of babysitting. Havana category rooms cater to adults, with access to a private bar and pool, as well as extra-large outdoor spaces and rainfall showers in suites."

Carnival Breeze offers a variety of cabin categories, all of which include flat-screen TVs and 24-hour room service. The ship maintains a nearly 1-to-3 crew-to-guest ratio.

Among other firsts, Magic was the world’s first vessel with a ropes course at sea.

Those just looking to relax can book a treatment at the spa or soak in the whirlpools at the Serenity Adult-Only Retreat.  The ship's sheer size (carrying up to 3,690 passengers and 1,367 crew members) also means more versatile dining options. Passengers can pick from an abundance of venues, including two main dining rooms and the expansive Lido buffet. When they aren't eating or exploring the ship, travelers can also kick back in their cabins. While Interior and Ocean View staterooms are more affordable and compact, Balcony and Suite category rooms offer more space and better ocean views."

Other family-friendly entertainment includes movies at the Seaside Theatre and the Seuss at Sea program.  Those more interested in relaxing can enjoy the Cloud 9 Spa and the adults-only Serenity Retreat. In terms of lodging, cruisers can stay in budget-friendly Interior staterooms (185 square feet) or splurge for more room (up to an extra 245 square feet) with an Ocean View or Balcony stateroom or Suite. All cabins are appointed with flat-screen TVs and 24-hour room service. The ship added quite a few dining options in its most recent revamp in 2017, including Guy's Burger Joint, BlueIguana Cantina and Bonsai Sushi. Overall, the food quality on the ship gets mixed reviews. Carnival Dream carries 3,646 passengers and offers a nearly 4-to-1 guest-to-crew ratio, so public areas may be crowded and service can slow at peak times. Recent travelers also warned against choosing a room directly above any of the restaurants or bars, as noise travels easily through the walls."

When it comes to lodging, Harmony of the Seas offers a wide variety of cabin categories, with more than 70 percent of cabins featuring balconies.

While this ship is not for those seeking secluded spaces, most cruisers say the seven distinct onboard neighborhoods make up for that. The behemoth ship features designer boutiques and larger staterooms than other ships in the fleet. Like other Royal Caribbean vessels, Oasis of the Seas offers four cabin categories: Interior, Ocean View, Balcony and Suite. Interior rooms average about 150 square feet, while Suite category cabins can span anywhere from 287 to 1,524 square feet and include added amenities like Jacuzzis and expansive balconies.

The only reason for the four stars instead of the five was because the ship was overcrowded and I feel like the crew could’ve helped with crowd control at the pool or in the atrium Because the people were rude and wouldn’t get out of your way when you were trying to walk down to a hall and they walked very slow and did not care and weren’t very friendly. I can’t base this review on the actual cruise line it was just the luck of the draw for what type of people who lacked manners and weren’t polite. Cookie our cruise director was more than amazing and deserves 20 stars the dining room staff deserves 20 stars and I especially loved Adrian he was our head waiter and he really made us feel special every single night and you can tell he took pride in his work. So my only complaint was the was the people that were on the ship with us I just feelLike we were stuck with a rude crowd.",

Our Havana suite was wonderful, steward was ok but not fantastic as we had hoped. The food was very good and plenty of options, so not sure why some reviews were so negative. Cookie, the cruise director was wonderful , he was so much fun in everything he did. Our next cruise will be on the Glory as that is where Cookie will be next. All in all we had a wonderful trip and are looking forward to our next one. We have cruised Carnival the most and have tried Royal Carib. ( beautiful ship but too big for us) and NCL ( run down ship and a different type of cruiser than we are used to) , We always go back to Carnival. Please take the negative reviews with a grain of salt, we all have different opinions and the trip will be what you make of it .. ENJOY !!!",

We arrived in the Port of Miami at 1040, expecting to wait until 1230 to check in. That was not the case. It appears that each port has its own way of doing things. We were rushed thru the process and was aboard at 1110. I cant complain about that. Tampa made you sit and wait until your time was called. So nicely done. Once onboard, you have to wait until 1 30 to get to your room, which is expected. Most Carnival cruisers know to go to the Lido and grab lunch usually at Guy's burgers or inside at the buffet. It was very busy to say the least. Food was good at Guy's burgers. Once in our room the room was clean and neat. We met our room steward within 10 minutes. My requests we simple, we prefer morning room cleaning and ice. Which we received every day. The water I ordered was there as well. The crew on our deck was very good.",

This means you will wait if you aren't diamond or platinum. If I had to do it over, I would have waited to become platinum before doing this cruise. The ship is awesome but I will now add cough syrup to the list. Many got an upper respiratory virus on this cruise which is not Carnival's fault; however, they could have done a better job cleaning. I noticed the Breeze did not have as many alcohol gel stations as other ships. The bathrooms often have 4 stalls and only one dryer which means people will NOT wash their hands. I hope they get this figured out. Layout was the typical 'Dream' Class ship. I did notice there were not as many stewards cleaning the common areas. Our waiters in the main dining room were amazing. Esumitra, Zara, and Joaquim made us feel like we were the only ones dining. You really get to know someone when you sail for 14 days. Millicent at the coffee bar was absolutely awesome.",

After hearing all about our cruise she was excited to join us this time. Freedom didn't disappoint. Our first site of that huge ship was awesome. Our arrival at the port could not have gone quicker. We were on board by 1 pm and started looking around all the decks. Lunch in Windjammer and drinks by the pool. Our room was a 6th deck balcony and was ready by 3 pm. It was great. Things might be worn but it was all good. We thought it was the room of our dreams. Our room attendant was Winsome from Jamaica? And she was a daily gift. I could not have asked for more. Dining in the main dining room was a fun, elegant time for us. We had great diner mates from Dallas and Columbus. The only meal we did not love was the lasagna.

As written in other reviews, yes the ship is older than the newer generation ships and parts of it are looking dated, however it was kept immaculately clean, it is a well designed and easy to navigate ship and the entertainment and activities on offer are numerous and generally very good. Food in the buffet and main dining room was excellent and the drinks served were absolutely fine. No problem at all getting a sun lounger even on sea days, great pools, well equipped gym and the waterslides were great - we really loved the tidal wave!",

We have sailed with Royal about 15 times and have most of the larger ships but first time on the Symphony. We choose an inside cabin because we knew that we were never going to be in the room. Embarkation was very easy with the We enjoyed two of the specialty restaurants, Chops and Jaime's Italian. We had anytime dining but had reservations and were able to get our same table every night that we are in the main dining room. Lourdes and Sonny were incredible. We did not have enough time to do everything and could have stayed on the ship for another week. Even though there were over 5000 people on board the only time it ever felt crowded was the first day at the windjammer buffet and a few times at dinner when you are waiting in line. Make sure you reserve your shows and dinner times on line and you will not have a problem. My favorite show was the comedy and the ice show but all the entertainment was great. The port were not great but you do not even need to get off the ship.I can't wait to go on this ship again.",

We did my time dining and the food and service was excellent. Plenty to do on board for the kids as well as the adults. The ship never felt overcrowded even when we had a day of rain, so many places for people to disperse to. Never had a problem getting a bed round the pool and the shop was at capacity.",

    body: "This was our first Royal Caribbean cruise and we were attracted by both the opportunity to be on one of the largest ships at sea and by the . Before booking and then for almost every day before sailing we researched the ship, looked at other reviews and spoke with the travel agent about what to expect. We were concerned about a number of reviews that referenced a tired ship and about Royal Caribbean's reported practice of 'nickel and diming' guests to extort as much additional money as possible. I absolutely have to address these issues because they are absolutely not our experience. The ship is overwhelmingly big but it is in beautiful order. Yes there is some upgrade necessary. If you are the type of guest who will obsess about handrails that have been bleached by the sun and are in need of sanding and re-varnishing then look elsewhere because your holiday may be ruined! Otherwise, have no fears - it's spotlessly clean, the staff are friendly and attentive and there is much to do. Not once were we approached about upgrades or trips, nor were we pushed for additional tipping or anything else.",

Ship is enormous with over 5500 passengers but it didn't seem crowded. We had a balcony cabin that was ocean view. Crew was very friendly. No issues with any member. Only saw the cruise director 1 time and that was at an evening show. Entertainment was very good..",

    body: "Our very first time on a cruise. We were family of 6, adjoining rooms with daughter, son in law , 4 yr old and 6 yr old. Rooms were immaculate and the veranda views were beautiful. Disney app made scheduling character sessions, shows, activities and messaging between family members easy and convenient. Food at cabanas was very good and varied. Shows were fantastic and magical for both the children and adults. Kids enjoyed the kids club and attended 3 out of 5 days for 2 hours each day which was a little nice break for both them and the adults. Prices at clubs for drinks and food were comparable to city eateries. Kids were able to see each character because we kept an eye on timing and made sure we were early for each activity plus set alerts on the app which were very useful and we took our own pictures , no need for photo package. Since it was a repositioning cruise our port stop was Antigua, took a brief walk to see some local sites, church and people then headed early back to ship for some pool/slide time in a calmer atmosphere.",

    body: "No one does it better than Disney! After the terrible experience of taking my first cruise on Carnival about 5 years ago I was real hesitant to go cruising again...least to say I'm very glad I gave Disney a try because they changed my perspective on the whole cruising industry. Our cruise was a 7 night to the Mexican Rivera with stops in Cabo, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta. The room was great! We had a family balcony stateroom which was very spacious and could sleep up to 5 people with 4 beds in the room. The split bathrooms on Disney ships are genius, especially for getting ready in the mornings. Our room steward Lorenzo was amazing!",

    body: "I chose Disney because of the rave reviews that I had researched and heard about from friends and acquaintances. In general, my family and I had a great time. The services and staff were great and very accommodating when things didn’t work as expected like trying to dial ship to shore from my stateroom. The ship is impeccably well maintained and clean and there is plenty for passengers of all ages to do during the voyage. My only criticism is that while the food was good, some of the dishes could have been served hotter than they were. I realize they are serving the masses, but the hot entrees should not arrive cool or cold to passengers. If the time duration from the stove top to the passenger was reduced, I think I would rate the food as great to outstanding. Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to travel again with Disney and hope to do so very soon.", rating: 4,

    body: "We chose this cruise because our 3 year old grand-daughter is obsessed with Disney. Our Grand-daughter enjoyed this cruise and overall I thought it was a good solid cruise experience. However, I did not feel it was a good value for the money and overall it was just ok. For what I paid for this cruise, it should have been extraordinary and it just wasn't. We were on the eight day Halloween on the High Seas cruise. I'll try to lay out each aspect and describe what I thought was good and bad. We are frequent cruisers, primarily on RCCL, but have cruise most of the other lines as well.",
